Your portfolio is one of the most powerful tools in my software developer toolbox; itâ€™s the easiest way of showing what I am truly capable of as a developer...

Mobile first approach

My portfolio is prepared for different screen sizes. However, I built my portfolio by using "mobile first" approach. 

Project requirements

For this first project, I used the HTML & CSS linter.
The 2 sections I built for this project are:
  - the toolbar (or header):
  - the headline section (right after the header):
I chosed the Laura Jong's template: https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=23%3A10.

In order to lay out the elements on the page I used Flexbox in all 2 sections.
I didn't use JavaScript, only html & css.

I was stuck to the design as much as possible (e.g. font, colors, images, text, margins) using the templates in Figma.

I implemented the button interactions (enable, hover, etc.).

NB: In this project 1 I worked individually
